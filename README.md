# LearnERA - A Student AI Agent by Team ByteBOND üéì
ERA=Education, Resources and Assistance

Welcome to LearnERA! This is a simple, browser-based AI assistant we designed to help students with their daily academic challenges.

## ‚ú® A Note From Our Team

We are thrilled to present LearnERA, our very first project as a team. Our goal was to build something helpful and engaging, and we poured our hearts into creating a tool that we, as students, would genuinely use.

As we are just beginning our journey in web development, we haven't yet mastered backend technologies for securely managing API keys on a server. We believe in being transparent about our learning process. For this reason, our app has been designed to ask the judges to use their own free Google AI API key to test the functionality. This was the best solution we could implement with our current skills to ensure the app works for you without us exposing a secret key publicly.

We tried our very best to create a polished and useful tool. We are incredibly proud of what we've accomplished and are so excited to keep learning and improving. Thank you for your time and for judging our project. We hope you enjoy using LearnERA!
